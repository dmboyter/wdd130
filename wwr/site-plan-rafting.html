            <h2>Overview</h2>
        
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>-    To reach out to a larger audience.</p>
                <p>-    To make booking easier and more accessible to those planning vacations.</p>
                <p>-    Networking with other businesses to drive further traffic.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
                <p>-	This website will serve to target the audience of adventurous families. In our modern world where our primary source of information lives in our pockets daily, we need a digital presence when an overworked mom or dad is looking for an exciting vacation. They don’t have time to waste in their everyday lives calling a phone number and seeking a booking from a person on the other end of a phone. Our site will offer booking availability, at a glance, offer to send calendar pushes to their phone, and text reminders to make the entire process seamless and easy. Additionally we may use this site for a secondary audience for other businesses that would benefit from adding our services to a package to drive traffic to one another in a mutually beneficial network. </p>
                <h4>•   Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation, interests, and so on)</h4>
                    <p>-    The overworked parents who find themselves planning a vacation and do not want to waste time but seek an at a glance solution.</p>
                <h4>•	What are their needs that aren't being met?</h4>
                    <p>-	Easy to access availability at a glance with booking options.</p>
                    <p>-	Clear package options with complete breakdown showing emphasis of services included and clear price point of that package.</p>
                    <p>-	Optional systems of notification that will assist the overworked parent by offering to place scheduled excursion in the clients calendar or send text reminders.</p>
                <h4>•	How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?</h4>
                    <p>-	This website will serve to target the audience of adventurous families. In our modern world where our primary source of information lives in our pockets daily, we need a digital presence. We will make our site mobile friendly to accommodate the busy on the go customer. Research into a companion app would be beneficial in the future.</p>
